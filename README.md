# Backtesting
Backtesting Investment Strategies

## Directions

To run the experiment first ensure all packages are installed (beautifulsoup4, yfinance), then run `python backtesting_experiment.py`

The first run will be slow because it has to pull data from statmuse and yfinance.

Subsequent runs will be much faster due to data in the cache.
